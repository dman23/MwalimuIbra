    <h2> Help Sponsor a Child's Education in Most Vulnerable Communities in Somalia </h2>
  </marquee>

        <h2>About Us</h2>
        
        <p>
        Ideas for the project began as far back as 2015 when two friends agreed to try their best and help a poor community in the Southern Somali village of Hosingow. By late 2023, efforts to rescue local primary school began.
    </p>
        <p>
        Project RSH aims to improve the livelihoods of residents of Hosingow, Somalia, by building access to quality education in the first phase of the project. Hosingow is a remote village in Somalia, where ongoing conflict continues to drive away foreign aid and leave thousands of residents without access to the most basic human needs. RSH's goal is to engage local actors to implement collaborative initiatives that will catalyze lasting prosperity. The primary school is our main educational project as a primary school is a critical component of a child's development.
    </p>
        <p>
        The education program RSH directly aligns with United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 4: to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. Crucially, the school will be accommodated to the cultural and religious specifics of the local community.
        </p>
            <p>
            Decades-long civil war and conflict, a failed state, weak government, lack of social support, poverty, harsh climate and poor security continue to make Somalia one of the poorest and most tragic countries in the world. The need for humanitarian aid is crucial in Somalia but seems to be extremely difficult. Warlords, militias, and terrorist groups such as al-Shabaab continue to operate in large parts of the country, resulting in both physical and psychological damage to civilians.
